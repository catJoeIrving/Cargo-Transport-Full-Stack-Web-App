# Cargo-Transport-Full-Stack-Web-App


Interstellar Cargo Transportation is a web application built using a standard 3-tier architecture. It utilizes Flask, a Python-based web framework, to power the backend API services, which interact with a relational database to manage information about cargo, spaceships, and captains. For the frontend, the application uses JavaScript and the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template system to create a dynamic, user-friendly interface. Authentication is handled in-memory on the server side, allowing for basic user login functionality. The application provides users with the ability to manage intergalactic cargo shipments with an intuitive, user-centric design.
